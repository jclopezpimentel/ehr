<!-- 
  - ganache/
  - apigateway/
  - birthCertificate/
  - smartContracts/
  - users/
  - scholarCurriculum/
  - digitalIdentity/
  - frontendUsersInteface/

## Environment-Based Installation
Before proceeding to the installation steps, it is required to set the environment. We provide: 
<!-- two options [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://github.com/UPTokenizing/digitalIdentity/blob/main/AWS-Setup.md) or -->
within a [local machine](Local-Setup.md).


---

## Deployment
  Execute the following instructions:    
  1. Follow the **Deployment** instructions explained in file [README.md](ganache/Deployment.md) within folder [ganache/](ganache/Deployment.md).
  2. Then, follow the **Deployment** instructions explained in file [README.md](apigateway/Deployment.md) within folder [apigateway/](apigateway/Deployment.md).
  3. Next, follow the **Deployment** instructions explained in file README.md within folder [birthCertificate/](birthCertificate/Deployment.md).
 <!-- 4. Following with the **Deployment** instructions explained in file README.md within folder [digitalIdentity/](https://github.com/UPTokenizing/digitalIdentity/tree/main/digitalIdentity/Deployment.md).--> 
  4. After digital Identity, follow the **Deployment** instructions explained in file [README.md](entities/Deployment.md) within folder [users/](entities/Deployment.md).
<!--  6. After digital Identity, follow the **Deployment** instructions explained in file README.md within folder [scholarCurriculum/](https://github.com/UPTokenizing/digitalIdentity/tree/main/scholarCurriculum/Deployment.md). 
  7. Lastly, follow the **Deployment** instructions explained in file README.md within the folders of for the user interactions [frontendBirthCertificate/](https://github.com/UPTokenizing/digitalIdentity/tree/main/frontendBirthCertificate/Deployment.md), [frontendIdentityDigital/](https://github.com/UPTokenizing/digitalIdentity/tree/main/frontendIdentityDigital/Deployment.md), [frontendUsersInterface/](https://github.com/UPTokenizing/digitalIdentity/tree/main/frontendUsersInteface/Deployment.md), [frontendScholarCurriculum/](https://github.com/UPTokenizing/digitalIdentity/tree/main/frontendScholarCurriculum/Deployment.md).
  8. **Check that the MySQL Database is running. In case it is down, for local installation run the command:**
   ```bash
    sudo docker start <DB_HOST>.
   ```
--> 
You might execute the following command in the host operating system to check if every service is ok:
    
    curl -X GET http://localhost:5500/proofEntity
<!--    curl -X GET http://localhost:5500/proof
    curl -X GET http://localhost:5500/proofd
    curl -X GET http://localhost:5500/proofsc
-->

It must return:
   
    Returning: route /proof users
<!--    Returning: route /proof
    Returning: route /proof digital
    Returning: route /proof scholarCertificates
-->

### After completing the installation and deployment process, follow the [User Manual](https://github.com/UPTokenizing/digitalIdentity/blob/main/UserManual.pdf).
